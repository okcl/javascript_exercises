# Arrow functions - Exercise 3

Turn the variables functions into arrow functions and combine the functions so that the result of the following mathematical operation is printed on the console: `((2 + 4) * (5 + 2) - 2) / 5`



const sum = (a, b) => a + b;


const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;


const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

const divide = (a, b) => a / b;


const log = (value) => console.log(value);
